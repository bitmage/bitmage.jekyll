title: Personify Monads

Personify leverages monad constructor agents at build time.  When utilized in this fashion, generic tests can be written within the constructor agent which verify that the functions you provide satisfy the monadic contract.

This is a realistic case where a third party library can inject unit tests into your application.  Enforcing the monadic contract means that the encapsulated state will maintain uniform type throughout the application's life.

Thus, a compile time type safety is introduced which is beyond the capabilities of 'types' in the object oriented sense. OOP ensures type consistency across all data, leading to rigidity which is unnecessary and often undesirable.  In contrast, a monadic contract is applied only to the functions that mutate application state.  Since the mutators are pure in regards to the encapsulated data, the data's consistency is mathematically provable through 'abstract nonsense' as category mathematicians are apt to call it.

One thought I have is to use monads to model the patterns described in "Model Driven Design Using Business Patterns".
